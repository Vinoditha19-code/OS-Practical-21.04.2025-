Practical _01
Finding Fibonacci Series 
This script prompts the user to enter the number of Fibonacci terms they want to generate. 
It uses a for loop to calculate the Fibonacci sequence by repeatedly adding the previous two numbers (a and b) to form the next term (c). 
The initial values of a and b are 0 and 1, which are the first two terms of the Fibonacci series. The result is printed line by line until the desired number of terms (num) is reached.

Practical_02
The script calculates the factorial of a user-provided number. It starts by asking for input, initializes the factorial to 1 (fact=1), and uses a for loop to multiply fact by each number up to the input. 
Finally, it prints the result. Note: The spaces around = in fact = 1 should be removed to avoid errors.

Practical_03
The script prints multiples of 3 from 1 to 50. It starts with a header message and uses a for loop to iterate through numbers. An if condition checks divisibility by 3, and matching numbers are printed. It's straightforward and efficient.

Practical_04
The script calculates a value from the user-input date and uses a case statement to display predefined messages like "lucky" or "happy." However, the variable b is uninitialized, which may cause errors. Refining the logic for c would ensure consistent results, making the script more reliable and enjoyable.
